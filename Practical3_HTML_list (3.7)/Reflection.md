* The provided code is an HTML file that contains a table displaying the grades of a student for their courses.

* The table has a header row with column names and then rows for each course with the respective grades.
 
*  The code also includes a ` <header> ` section with a navigation bar and a ` <footer> ` section.

* Brief explanation of the code:

````
<!DOCTYPE html>: This is a declaration that tells we
 browsers that this document is an HTML5 document.

<html lang="en">: This is the root element of an HTML
 page. The lang attribute specifies the language of the page.

 <head>: This element contains meta information about
  the document, such as the character set and viewport
   settings.
  
<meta charset="UTF-8">: This meta tag specifies the
 character encoding for the HTML document.

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,
 initial-scale=1.0">: This meta tag sets the viewport
  settings for the web page, ensuring that the page is
   displayed correctly on different devices.

<title>Document</title>: This element specifies the
 title of the HTML document, which is displayed in the 
 browser's title bar or tab.

<style>: This element contains CSS styles for the HTML 
document. In this case, it sets the border style for 
tables, table headers, and table cells.

<header>: This element contains the header section of 
the HTML document. It includes a navigation bar with a 
heading "Semester Assignment Grade:".

<main>: This element contains the main content of the 
HTML document. In this case, it contains a table with 
grades for the student's courses.

1.  <table>: This element creates an HTML table. It has 
a header row with column names and then rows for each 
course with the respective grades.

1.  <footer>: This element contains the footer section 
of the HTML document. It is currently empty.


3.  </body>: This tag closes the <body> element, which 
contains the visible page content.

4.  </html>: This tag closes the ``` <html> ``` 
element, which is the root element of an HTML document.

   Things I have learned through this assignment are:

1. **New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:**
   - I have learned how to create and structure an HTML document, including the use of unordered and ordered lists, as well as nested lists.
   - I have gained experience in using Figma for designing user interfaces and creating wireframes.
   - I have improved my understanding of HTML and CSS, and how they work together to create dynamic web pages.
   - I have learned how to use Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration with others.
   - I have improved my problem-solving skills by tackling various coding challenges and debugging issues that arose during the course of the assignment.

2. **Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:**
   - One challenge I faced was understanding how to structure my code in a way that was both organized and easy to read. To overcome this, I made sure to use descriptive variable and function names, as well as adding comments to explain the purpose of different sections of my code.
   - Another challenge was ensuring that my HTML and CSS code was compatible across different browsers and devices. To address this, I tested my code on multiple browsers and devices to ensure that it rendered correctly and consistently.
   - I also faced challenges in designing user interfaces using Figma. To overcome this, I spent time researching best practices for UI design and experimented with different layouts and design elements until I found a solution that worked well for my project.
   - Lastly, I encountered some difficulties in debugging my code when errors occurred. To resolve these issues, I used online resources such as Stack Overflow and the Mozilla Developer Network to find solutions to specific problems I was facing.
