# New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:
HTML Structure and Semantics:

I deepened my understanding of how to structure a website using semantic HTML. I learned how to use elements like header, main, section, and footer to create a well-organized and accessible page layout.

1. CSS Flexbox and Layout Techniques:

I gained skills in creating responsive layouts using CSS Flexbox. This helped me align items on the page efficiently, making the design look good across different screen sizes. Flexbox also made it easier to manage multi-column layouts, such as for the team and portfolio sections.

2. Styling Buttons and Forms:

I learned how to design buttons and form elements using custom styles. This allowed me to create visually appealing call-to-action buttons and input fields that align with the overall website design.

3. Image Handling:

I acquired knowledge on how to handle images in HTML and CSS by learning how to properly size them using percentages and ensuring they are responsive. I also learned to set background images for sections, as seen in the hero area of the page.
4. Embedding Interactive Elements:


# Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:
Challenge: Responsive Design Issues:

Initially, some sections of the webpage (like the portfolio and team members) did not look good on smaller screens.
Solution: I researched and implemented CSS media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. I also used Flexbox's wrapping feature to make sure items adapt to smaller screens by stacking vertically.

1. Challenge: Aligning Content in Flexbox:

I faced difficulty aligning the content in the "Project Portfolio" and "Our Amazing Team" sections. Items would not center properly or align as I expected.
Solution: I read more about Flexbox properties such as justify-content, align-items, and flex-direction, which helped me understand how to control the alignment and positioning of elements.

2. Challenge: Google Maps API Integration:

Getting the Google Map to display and work properly was a challenge. I struggled with generating the API key and implementing the correct JavaScript for initialization.
Solution: I consulted the Google Maps API documentation and went through troubleshooting steps to properly generate the API key and embed the map script within the HTML.

3. Challenge: CSS Specificity and Conflicting Styles:

Some CSS styles were being overridden, which caused elements to not display as intended (e.g., buttons not showing the correct color).
Solution: I learned about CSS specificity and how to properly target elements to ensure my styles were applied as expected. I also used browser developer tools to inspect and debug CSS issues.

4. Challenge: Image Sizing and Responsiveness:

Images in the portfolio and blog sections were not scaling properly, either becoming distorted or not fitting well within their containers.
Solution: I learned to use the max-width: 100% and height: auto properties in CSS to maintain the aspect ratio of images while making them responsive.
By working through these challenges, I was able to develop stronger skills in both HTML and CSS and gain more confidence in building responsive, functional webpages.
