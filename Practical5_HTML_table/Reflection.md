### Things I Have Learned Through This Assignment:

 Creating an HTML table for a weekly course schedule allowed me to better understand the use of HTML tags and CSS for styling tables, including thead, tbody, and custom cell properties like text-align and padding to improve readability.

### New Skills or Knowledge Acquired:

- Structured HTML tables for organizing data effectively.
- Used CSS for consistent table styling.
- Improved my understanding of HTML page layouts.

### Challenges Faced and How They Were Overcome:
 One challenge was ensuring the table remained readable and balanced on different screen sizes. To address this, I used CSS styling and chose a simple, flat structure without merged cells to keep the schedule straightforward and clear. I also improved the appearance by adding some space between rows and columns. This hands-on exercise in HTML and CSS layout was essential for making the schedule visually appealing and well-organized.
