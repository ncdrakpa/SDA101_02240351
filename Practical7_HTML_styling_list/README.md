# 2. Styling List

Create an HTML file with an ordered list of at least 5 college events. Each event should include the event name, time, and location as nested unordered list.

Style the list using CSS to make it stand out:

<ul>
<li>Use custom bullets or numbers instead of default ones
</li>

<li>Add hover effects that change the color of the text or background when the user hovers over an event.</li>

<li>Include spacing and padding to ensure the list is easy to read.</li>
</ul>
